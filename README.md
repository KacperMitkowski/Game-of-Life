# Conway's Game Of Life

## What's Conway's Game Of Life?
Conway's Game Of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.<br />

## About the project:
It is my implementation of Conway's game of life in Java. The project was created during my education in Codecool.<br/>
**The goal was to:**
* practice OOP concept in Java
* practice MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern in a desktop application
* create a game loop with the option to pause and change the speed
* use JavaFx as a GUI

The game starts with a blank board filled with blue balls whose coordinates come from project code. The game has a pause option, and an option to change its speed.<br/>


## Used technology:
* Java
* JavaFx
